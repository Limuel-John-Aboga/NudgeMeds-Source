# NudgeMeds-Source
The source code for the NudgeMed's product SmartPill box. Made by one and only William Otsuro, He has a John now. Anyway, it was been such a long time ever since I came back to the business, regardless, here I am, still depressed, colder, and a hater! Anyway sending best regrets to LazyMath, it had been untouched ever since I step on senior high. Lazymath soon new uploads, maybe a chi-square test would do? By the way, I had done this work on behalf of work immersion, so if you've gone here, probably I was already at college. What I study? I don't know, maybe business? XD.
